# UNCC_Week-3_Homeworks
This homework has 4 python source code files - one for each part of the homework 1)PyBank, 2)PyPoll, 3)PyBoss and 4)PyParagraph
I did PyBank, PyBoss and PyParagraph using native python.
I did PyPoll using dataframes and pandas - just to practice different things...
I also attached some screenshots for the results I got with our input files that came in the raw_data folder
My code will work for all input files, you have to specify the input files and they need to be in the raw_data folder, one level 'above' the source code file folder
The path (item 6 above) can always be changed in the code if you want to keep the source files in the 'same parent folder' as the source code files
@Dzmitri - This time I have made sure I have written as much comments as possible in my code!
